# Yield Prediction Project
## To predict corn yield  based on historical yield and weather information

Specific tasks include:
1. Literature review and quantity the effect of improvements in technology on yield responses
2. Implement the Thompson's model (original and modified)
3. Analyze model performance, strengths, weaknesses and effect of resolution
4. Discuss potential model improvements
